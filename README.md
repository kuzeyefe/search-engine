# Text Based OOP Search Engine

In this project I implemented inverted index method used in search engines. It reads thousands of documents and indexed data using hash table data structure.
After the indexing operation you can use search function to find a keyword and you get result in seconds. You can see the documents in which the keyword appears.

Separated chaining, linear probing and double hashing methods are used for collision problems.

I also used factory design pattern, singleton pattern, polymorphism, interfaces and abstract classes for modularity.
